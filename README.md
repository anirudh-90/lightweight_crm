# Lightweight CRM for Small Businesses & Freelancers

The Vision: 
We wanted to create a Customer Realationship AManagment tool To help a small sales team or freelance/solo entrepreneur manage sales data for their business.
This is meant for people who donâ€™t want to use bloated and expensive tools like Hubspot or Salesforce. 
The Minimium Viable Product will be entirely for internal use with potential for SaaS scalability.
